    Use Faker library to get 10000 random profiles. Using namedtuple, calculate the largest blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age and average age (add proper doc-strings). - 250
    Do the same thing above using a dictionary. Prove that namedtuple is faster. - 250
    
    Create a fake data (you can use Faker for company names) for imaginary stock exchange for top 100 companies (name, symbol, open, high, close). Assign a random weight to all the companies. Calculate (for 50 instances during the day) and show what value stock market started at, what was the highest value during the day and where did it end. Make sure your open, high, close are not totally random. You can only use namedtuple. - 500

Add the notebook as well to your github where logs can be visible.
