This project demonstrate creation and usage of namedtuple collection of python.

For this I create 10000 random fake profiles and store in a list of namedtuple and dictionary. 
For both list we find the largest blood type, mean-current_location, oldest_person_age and average age.
When calulate it over a large number of iterations we find that the named tuple if faster then the dictionaries.
The same has shown in the jupyter notebook.

 I also show a example of stock data. Here we first create 100 fake random data for stock market and then find market open, highest and closing value for the day based on top 50 companies.
This example can also be seen in the notebook.
